This directory contains the raw data for replicating the analysis of archaeological radiocarbon and human bone isotope data in Freeman et al. ``The long-term expansion and recession of human populations."
In addition to the raw radiocarbon and isotope data, this file contains data on fire cracked rock feature size and the data necessary to calculate the cultivation index in the Middle Mississippi River valley.

The directory also contain processed data files. Transitions.csv summarizes per capita growth data from processed summed probability distributions and kernal density estimates.
ID=subsistence classification
Case=case identification
Transition Type=period of negative or positive per capita growth
Generations=number of consecutive generations of positive or negative per capita growth
Years= number of generations*30
ScaleID=identification of archaeoglobe or case study. 1 indicates archaeoglobe region.	
KDEID=identification of whether counts were made on KDE or SPDs. 1 indicates KDEs	
Peak=The maximum positive growth rate or minimum negative growth rate during a given consecutive period of positive or negative per capita growth.
